1. Falling in love the first time is all froth and fantasy. 初恋完全是一场虚幻的美梦。 
2. No substance at all, just froth. 根本没有任何实质，只是一些虚浮的东西。 
3. The froth is blown away. 泡沫给吹开了。 
1. They then dipped bird feathers into the froth. 
2. The pink nylon dress in a froth over her arm. 
3. Bring to the boil, skim away any froth thrown up.
