1. Advanced imported photoelectric supervision system is used. 采用先进的进口光电眼监控系统。 
2. Early results on the photoelectric effect had not produced consistent results. 有关光电效应的早期实验,并未取得协调一致的结果. 
3. Submit them to test on a photoelectric colorimeter or spectrophotometer. 把他们放在光电比色计或分光光度计上进行测定. 
1. Einsteins photoelectric explanation is incorrect by assuming photons. 
2. Electric photoelectric is not ready for vehicles but is developed enough for static use. 
3. In the photoelectric effect, substances that emit elections when exposed to light respond only to particyular frequencies.
