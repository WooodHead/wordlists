1. Changing stresses bring about more cracking and rock deformation. 不断变化的应力导致更多的断裂和岩石变形。 
2. a deformation of the spine 脊柱的畸变 
3. Normally, enormous deformation is abnormal. 通常，巨大的变形是不正常的。 
1. The cutting-edge system relies on a phenomenon called cluster deformation. 
2. This is 'elastic strain'; deformation that goes away when the load does. 
3. A material is rheid by virtue of the time of observation. Rocks...are so during geological deformation.
