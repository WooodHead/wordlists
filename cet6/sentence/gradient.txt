1. The car slid down the steep gradient into the river. 汽车滑下陡峭的斜坡掉入河中. 
2. This indicates a hydrodynamic condition with a very marked potentiometric gradient. 这说明水动力条件具有很明显的位能梯度. 
3. 4 gradient arrays marked A, B, C and D were set up. 布置了编号为A, B, C,D的四个梯度排列. 
1. Unless a continuous pressure gradient is present, natural barriers exist. 
2. This can be confirmed very easily through a static gradient test program. 
3. We should think, instead, in terms of a gradient of neglect.
