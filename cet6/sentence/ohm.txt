1. The electric resistance is measured in ohm. 电阻的测量单位是欧姆。 
2. The resistivity is then constant and Ohm's law is obeyed. 因此电阻率也是常数,并遵循欧姆定律. 
3. Hence comes the name of Ohm's Law. 欧姆定律就是由此命名的. 
1. Even the omega for ohm is a capital Greek letter. 
2. However, Ohm's Law cannot generate a theory of the atom. 
3. Ohm s Law and Schrodinger s eqn and many others are readily proven numerically.
