1. A red wire is often attached to the anode. 红色电线通常与阳极相联. 
2. The reverse process may proceed at the anode. 相反的过程也会在阳极上发生. 
3. The applied pressure acts on a diaphragm which in turn moves the anode pin. 施加的压力作用在一个膜片上,于是该膜片就移动阳极管脚. 
1. Graphene, a carbon structure in which the atoms lie in thin sheets of hexagons, formed the anode. 
2. O The anode and the cathode aren't solutions, they consist of metal or coal. 
3. There are just not enough anode and cathode metal ressources in the world to equip vehicles with batteries.
