1. From somewhere distant he heard the clatter of a typewriter. 他听见从远处什么地方传来打字机的嗒嗒声。 
2. The dishes and bowls slid together with a clatter. 碟子碗碰得丁丁当当的. 
3. Don't clatter your knives and forks. 别把刀叉碰得咔哒响. 
1. The clatter of dishes alternated with the sound of chewing. 
2. Richard heard, along with the clatter of Bonita's heels. 
3. Shut yer trap,...and leave this daft clatter about Sir Lancelot. 
1. The clatter came from the kitchen where pans were being washed. 厨房里传来了刷洗盘子的叮当声。 
1. His own cry, which clattered down the silent ravines,was borne back to his ears in the countless repetitions. 他自己的叫声在寂静的山谷回响，一而再、再而三地传回到他耳中。 
2. Dishes and plates were clattering in the dining car. 盘碟在餐车中铿锵作响。
