1. A proton is an elementary particle of matter. 质子是物质的基本粒子。 
2. An electron has a negative charge, a proton has a positive charge. 电子带负电荷, 质子带正电荷. 
3. At present nobody understands why these three quarks which are in the proton are bound together. 目前还没有人知道质子里面的这三个夸克为什么会结合在一起。 
1. That could explain "compression" of the proton. 
2. Single proton has no quant of information. Why? 
3. Proton decay - hadn't thought about for a while!
