1. the jingle of coins in his pocket 他兜里硬币的叮当声 
2. a peppy advertising jingle 热情洋溢的广告歌 
3. The key fell on the ground with a jingle. 钥匙叮当落地. 
1. The Demons, they retain a pleasing Buddy Holly jingle jangle. 
2. There was even a jingle created along these lines three years ago. 
3. Harmonicas wail in from a distance, bells jingle out back, horns blast, and an accordion joins the fray.
