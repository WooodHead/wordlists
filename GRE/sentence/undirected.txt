1. Unenlightened and undirected, I can do so little. 但若得不到启蒙和指导，我就差不多无能为力了。 
2. A circ is an undirected graph having only vertices of even nonzero degree. 一广义圈是一无向图,其顶点次数都是非零偶数. 
3. This paper shows that undirected circulant graphs must contain efficient dominating sets. 该文证明了无向循环图一定存在有效控制集. 
1. He had...an undirected, if intense, desire to write. 
2. They're all fatuous, self-obsessed, undirected, confused, emotional retards. 
3. Personally, I find it very hard to believe that these elements came about through an undirected process.
