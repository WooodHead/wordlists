1. The quantity of chemical pollutants has increased exponentially. 化学污染物排放量已经迅速增加。 
2. A specimen which is much thicker than the penetration depth decays exponentially. 一个比穿深透度厚得多的样品,按指数律衰减. 
3. The entrainment rate should closely decrease exponentially with freeboard height. 夹带率应几乎随自由空域高度成指数递减. 
1. That would increase scientific knowledge about Solar System exponentially. 
2. Our consumption of fossil fuels globally is increasing exponentially. 
3. But those increase geometrically and cubically not exponentially.
