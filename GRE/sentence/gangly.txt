3. At Monaco he had shown faith in a gangly, young striker called George Weah. 在摩纳哥他信任身材瘦小的年轻射手威赫. 
1. I asked a gangly teen-ager in a tuxedo who he was. 
2. He is a big, tall, gangly lad and they just lumped the ball forward to him. 
3. There were thoughts of home and the wild celebrations going on in Jamaica and the children who adore their gangly icon.
