1. The ersatz spontaneity of "Sunday Love" sounds especially hollow. 对这首歌的即兴模仿听起来尤其空洞。 
2. There were few provisions available in exchange for food stamps: ersatz coffee, macaroni, small cubes of margarine. 可以用来换取粮票的食物只有这些：代用咖啡、通心粉和小块的人造黄油。 
3. Tourists are the ones having the ersatz experience. 观光客得到的是一种模拟的感受. 
1. I stole packets of sugar and containers of ersatz cream. 
2. The external social drama which is as dehydrated and ersatz as TV.
