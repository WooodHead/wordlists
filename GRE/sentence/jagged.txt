1. The bomb left a pile of jagged glass and twisted metal. 炸弹留下了一堆断口参差的玻璃碎片和扭曲变形的金属. 
2. The stark jagged rocks were silhouetted against the sky. 光秃嶙峋的岩石衬托着天空的背景矗立在那里. 
3. On all sides, skyscrapers rose like jagged teeth. 四周耸起的摩天大楼参差不齐. 
1. She imagines the jagged saw blades, the mess. 
2. A jagged purple scar puckered his right cheek. 
3. A rocky plateau...surrounded by jagged and hostile mountains.
