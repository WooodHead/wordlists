1. This city is a kaleidoscope of colours, smells, and sounds. 这个城市是各种颜色 、 气味和声音的万花筒. 
2. The search lights and the fireworks made the sky a kaleidoscope of colour. 探照灯和焰火使得天空的颜色千变万化. 
3. The bazaar was a kaleidoscope of strange sights and impressions. 集市的景象光怪陆离,纷然杂陈. 
1. With a sickening thump to my spine, the kaleidoscope stopped. 
2. The word challenging drops into the kaleidoscope of phrases he's tumbling around. 
3. He was no longer the centre of a flashing kaleidoscope of the clever, the beautiful, the worldly.
