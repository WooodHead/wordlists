1. Catholics pray to Mary as an intercessor. 天主教徒向玛利亚祈祷，并把她看作仲裁者。 
2. If it is done both of us have to name intercessor, it is too troubled. 那样做咱们双方就得指定仲裁员了.这样多麻烦. 
3. No intimate friend nor intercessor will the wrong - doers have, who could be listened to. 不义者,将没有任何亲友, 也没有奏效的说情者. 
1. The Church lost some of its role as mediator, intercessor, and dispenser of magic and solace.
