1. At low frequencies, such as 10 per sec., pulsation is sensed rather than vibration. 在低频率(譬如每秒十次)时, 所感觉到的是脉冲而非振动. 
2. If the roller pulsation, the pressure on paper as cause misregister. 如果滚子径向跳不静, 则差纸的不张辛有不小有小,致使套印禁绝. 
3. Vortexing can cause unstable pump operation, vibration, pulsation and severe mechanical damage. 涡流可能会导致泵运行不稳定 、 振动 、 跳动和严重的机械破坏. 
1. There is a plot, of sorts, amid the pulsation. 
2. But Cohn says the continuous-flow heart does the same without the pulsation. 
3. Movement from one block to the next can only occur at a particular point in the pulsation.
