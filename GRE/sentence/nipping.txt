2. The postman ran away with the dog nipping at his heel. 邮递员跑开了,狗在身后紧追着要咬他. 
3. He's nipping when I came in. 我走进去时他正一小口一小口地抿酒呢。 
1. It is a nipping and an eager air. ,Shakespeare 
2. Nipping out of the gallery again... back in a moment. 
3. The other weekend, though, I finally started nipping away.
