1. A neutron star has a gravitational field strong enough to generate X-rays. 中子星上存在强大的重力场，足以产生X射线。 
2. Its oscillation depends on the strength of the gravitational field. 它的振动幅度取决于引力场的强度。 
3. the gravitational pull of the moon 月球的引力 
1. Inertial velocity is thus distinct from synchronous gravitational mass. 
2. It is a free fall, a gravitational collapse. 
3. Think of their possible gravitational red-shift effect on radiation.
