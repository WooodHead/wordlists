1. The book was libelous, so the publishers had to call in all copies of it from the bookshops. 这是一本诽谤性的书, 所以出版商必须把店里的书全收回去. 
2. No evidence has been found in the case so far and therefore it is probably a libelous suit. 查无实据,恐怕是诬告. 
3. Here, the truer the scandal, the more libelous it is. 在这儿, 丑事愈真实,诽谤的罪就愈大. 
1. No admission was given to your libelous statement. 
2. Please let me know if you find something libelous on my blog.
