1. The whole town is in a festal mood. 全镇沉浸在节日的气氛之中。 
2. Sweet sweet lake goes vacationing village and streamers , send festal atmosphere. 香蜜湖度假村里张灯结彩, 一派节日气氛. 
3. Festal parade already lost rich former days religion color nowadays. 如今节日游行已失去往日浓厚的宗教色彩. 
1. Hymns...Sung by their Composers at their festal Solemnities. 
2. The ball-room wore an elegant and festal air. 
3. For, as Ratty might happily murmur to Mole on a festal day, there is nothing, absolutely nothing, quite like a flotilla.
