1. I felt frisky, as if I might break into a dance. 我感到很欢快, 似乎要跳起舞来. 
2. His horse was feeling frisky, and he had to hold the reins tightly. 马儿欢蹦乱跳，他不得不紧勒缰绳。 
3. I feel quite frisky this morning. 我今天上午觉得精神挺足. 
1. I...found my old master a frisky new tubmate fresh from the desert to appease his temper. 
2. My hands were free to frolic like frisky salamanders in the brief flame of her dress. 
3. It's got soul, certainly, but it's frisky, joyful and carefree.
