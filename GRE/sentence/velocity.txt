1. Acceleration and velocity are both vectors. 加速度和速度都是矢量。 
2. the velocity of light 光速 
3. Einstein's theory links energy with mass and velocity of light. 爱因斯坦的理论把能量同质量和光速联系起来. 
1. Inertial velocity is thus distinct from synchronous gravitational mass. 
2. Temperature correlates to atomic particle velocity and photon energy. 
3. So very, very close to the limiting velocity. 
1. A bullet goes from this gun with a velocity of 3000 feet per second. 此枪发出的子弹，其速度为每秒3000英尺。
