1. I felt a prickle of disquiet. 我觉得焦虑不安。 
2. The scream sent a prickle down my spine. 尖叫声听得我像针由上到下刺我的脊骨. 
3. My scalp began to prickle as I realized the horrible truth. 我了解到了那令人恐惧的事实,顿时感到不寒而栗. 
1. I felt a prickle at the back of my neck. 
2. A nice prickle on the tongue. 
3. But more often than not this is a record that will make all the hairs on the back of your neck prickle into life on their own.
