1. The square tower of a church loomed through the gloaming. 在薄暮中隐约可以看见一个教堂的方塔. 
2. Another girl wiggles by in the Brooklyn gloaming. 又是一个姑娘扭着腰肢在布鲁克林的暮色中走过. 
3. Shepherds was pelting through the gloaming their sheep and goats. 牧羊人在暮色中驱赶他们的羊群. 
1. The help...needed in the gloaming of their lives. 
2. Before the gloaming had thickened into darkness. 
3. Even the likeliest is little better than a shot in the gloaming.
