1. A thin, glistening thread of moisture ran along the rough concrete sill. 在粗糙不平的水泥窗台上有一条细细的发光水印。 
2. The Royal Airforce sill remained dangerously short of bombers. 英国皇家空军仍未脱离极为缺乏轰炸机的危境. 
3. The blind was drawn, but I found a rift at the sill. 遮帘拉了下来, 但我在窗台上找到了一个缝隙. 
1. The blind-cord drawls across the window sill. 
2. From the sill, a naked man dangled by his fingertips. 
3. The...posts are...tenoned into the sill.
