1. The cistern is empty but soon fills again. 蓄水池里现在没水,但不久就会储满水的. 
2. The lavatory cistern overflowed. 厕所水箱的水溢出来了. 
3. In final analysis, I am simply a cistern regularly filled, regularly drained. 归根结底, 我不过是一个蓄水池,定时装满, 又定时排空. 
1. Ponkrum had no well and only a simple cistern. 
2. If you don't have a dual flush toilet put a brick into the cistern to reduce capacity. 
3. It looked to me as if they did a pretty good job, even if I didn't fancy a cup of coffee made on the cistern of the lavatory.
