1. Their nuptial day hasn't been determined. 他们的结婚日还没有决定. 
2. I went to the room which he had called the nuptial chamber. 我走进了他称之为洞房的房间。 
3. He would not leave much mystery for the nuptial night. 他将不会给新婚之夜留下多少神秘. 
1. The extended nuptial celebrations...of the bride and groom. 
2. It is hard to think of anything less romantic than the pre-nuptial agreement. 
3. They were programmed to mate only during nuptial flights away from the nest.
