1. This colonnade will take you out of the palace and the game. 这条柱廊将带你离开宫殿和游戏。 
2. I looked at the Colonnade . I looked at the grass, my shoes. 我望望白宫的廊柱, 望望草地, 望望自己的鞋子. 
3. The terrace was embraced by the two arms of the colonnade. 平台由两排柱廊环抱. 
1. Its design is reminiscent of a Roman temple with a colonnade across the front. 
2. Late at night the famous square is magical, with the lights from colonnade throwing a painterly sheen on the pavement. 
3. She blends in too well with the bland opulence of the Promenade with its twinkly piano, colonnade, swags and silk cushions.
