2. From the shore they heard gonging and the blare of a mom. 船上四个人都听到从河街上飘来的锣鼓、琐呐声音. 
3. A blare of sunlight flooded the room as he opened the shutters. 他打开百叶窗,满房间泻进耀眼的阳光. 
1. Finally, the public-address system began to blare: Fire. 
2. VOTE YES, blare billboards that show the proposed constitution. 
3. The blare of the outside world goes on all around us, even while we attempt to focus on our real' lives.
