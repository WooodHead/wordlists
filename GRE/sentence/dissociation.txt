2. Ammonium chloride under thermal dissociation forms ammonia and hydrogen chloride gases. 氯化铵在热力分解作用下形成氨和氯化氢气体. 
3. Halogens also have the necessary absorption in the ultraviolet and rapid dissociation. 卤素也具有吸收紫外线和分解快这两种特性. 
1. This is NOT incineration, it is molecular dissociation. 
2. How is dissociation connected to your hypothesis? 
3. This patent is for the effective separation of the resulting dissociation species.
