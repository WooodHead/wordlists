1. I'm specializing in differential and integral calculus. 我正专攻微分学和积分学. 
2. After studying differential calculus you will be able to solve these mathematical problems. 学了微积分之后,你们就能够解这些数学题了. 
3. All this leads up to the most fundamental of theorems of calculus. 综上所述就导出了微积分学中的最基本的定理. 
1. Shall I explain calculus while I'm at it? 
2. That's the calculus that's going on here. 
3. Students should be using calculators until they reach calculus!
