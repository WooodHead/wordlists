1. I have now just confiscated a rather curious artifact for Mr. Potter. 我刚刚查抄了波特先生的一件相当可疑的人工制造品。 
2. A user interface is an artifact, not directly associated with the goals of a user. 用户界面是人造的, 并非直接和用户的目标相关. 
3. Now I have an artifact from every Florida shipwreck of the 1960's. 现在,我拥有60年代的每次在佛罗里达沉船的艺术品的人造品. 
1. Why destroy an authentic artifact to fake a facade? 
2. It's such an artifact totally untouched. 
3. What's interesting isn't the product but the cultural artifact.
