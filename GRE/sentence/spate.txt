1. The Thames was in spate, with flocks of Canada geese speeding downriver. 泰晤士河河水暴涨，成群的加拿大雁迅速游向下游。 
2. The bombing was the latest in a spate of terrorist attacks. 这次的爆炸事件是近期一连串恐怖主义袭击中最新的一起。 
3. Doctors have suffered a loss of prestige following a spate of scandals. 接二连三的丑闻使医生名誉扫地. 
1. A...spate roaring a furlong broad after the rains. 
2. The spotlight on graft follows a spate of corruption scandals. 
3. Something like the recent spate of rapes occurs.
