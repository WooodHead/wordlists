1. I am sending my apprentice, Darth Maul, to join you. 我会派我的徒弟, 达孜摩罗跟你们一起去. 
2. Mangle doesn't increase the damage of Maul and Shred anymore. 裂伤不再增加重殴和撕碎的伤害. 
3. Shockwave - Maul adds 5 % damage per point. 冲击波 - 理想的槌添加5%的伤害每点. 
1. I maul'd you when you look'd so bluff. 
2. The answer is just the same as in the maul. 
3. Our maul was exceptional and it was an area we targeted.
