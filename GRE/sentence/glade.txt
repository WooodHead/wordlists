1. In the midst of a glade were several huts. 林中的空地中间有几间小木屋. 
2. I feel deep sorry and glade for all of them. 我感到深切遗憾和林间空地的全部. 
3. The traveler sit on a glade in the forest. 旅行者坐在森林中一块空地上. 
1. A shady...glade, partly walled by...masses of upreared rocks. 
2. The mist...unrolled itself upon brook, glade, and tarn. 
3. Once this awakening happens, we will be glade to call Earth our home.
