1. On the first day of an American history class Prude University. 在印地安那州的西拉法市波督大学,我上的第一节美国历史课那天. 
2. Don't be such a prude you can carry modesty too far! 别那麽拘谨——你谦虚得太过分了. 
3. She's dreary little prude. 她是个死板、假正经的女人! 
1. I am not going to play the prude little girl. 
2. Renewable cheap electricity and water to prude hydrogen anywhere!!! 
3. Thus a "prude" is anyone who takes your eroticism and calls it porn.
