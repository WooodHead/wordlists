1. You ungrateful brat. 你这个没良心的小坏蛋。 
2. a snivelling little brat 爱哭闹的小淘气 
3. He's a spoilt brat and it's about time he learnt to behave properly. 他是个被宠坏的孩子，是该学些规矩了。 
1. Your loathsome idle spineless ill-mannered brat of an offspring. 
2. You must have been a nasty little brat. 
3. I should be glad to hear how the little brat doth.
