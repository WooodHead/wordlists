1. These small particles agglomerate together to form larger clusters. 这些颗粒聚结形成较大的团。 
2. As the rubber droplets lose the acetone solvent, they become tacky and agglomerate. 当橡胶滴失去丙酮溶液后, 变成粘的,聚集态的. 
3. Similarly charged colloidal particles cannot come close enough together to agglomerate into larger particles. 带相同电荷的胶粒不能紧密靠近,它们不能聚集成较大的颗粒.
