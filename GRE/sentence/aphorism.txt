1. Life is not composed by aphorism, how can we decorate it with pompous cliche & 1 & s? I send you my most sincere greeting in silence. 人生并非格言组成,岂能靠美丽的 辞章 来妆点, 默默中,有我对你最诚挚的祝福. 
2. It is the aphorism of the Asian Games. 这是亚运会的格言。 
3. It is an old aphorism. 这是一句老格言. 
1. This is an aphorism all of us should ponder. 
2. The aphorism in vino veritas has no applicability in a court. 
3. Be rigorously honest and don't "fake it till you make it", if that aphorism bothers you.
