1. The country is in the throes of a general election. 该国正忙于大选。 
2. The regime is now in its death throes. 这一政权大势已去。 
3. The creature went into its death throes. 这小生命到了临终疼痛阶段。 
1. The throes of a mortal and painful disorder. 
2. Tumultuous throes Of some vast grief. 
3. But I've been in the throes of them all my life.
