3. Behind the crude lectern, off to a side, stands a curtained puppet theatre. 在粗糙的读经台后面, 偏向一边, 是一座挂着幕布的木偶戏台. 
1. The classroom gently rocked as the speaker approached the lectern. 
2. He gripped the lectern, jabbing the air with his forefinger. 
3. The photograph showed Graham standing at a lectern with Lieberman and Kerry.
