1. Looking through the cabin window I saw the flicker of flames. 透过船舱的窗户我看到了闪烁的火光。 
2. He looked at me, a flicker of amusement in his cold eyes. 他看着我，冷酷的眼神里闪过一丝嘲笑。 
3. He felt a flicker of regret. 他突然感到一丝悔意。 
1. There was a flicker of hope in his eyes. 
2. He feels a vestigial flicker of anger from last night. 
3. Not once had a flicker of amusement...crossed that suffering mug. 
1. The candle-light flickered in the wind. 烛光在风中摇曳。
