1. Listen to the voice of illuminati. 聆听智者的声音。 
2. The Illuminati are disguised as the booth babes. Illuminati伪装成摊贩宝贝. 
3. So let me tell you what the Illuminati are doing these days. 所以让我告诉你这些日子里光明会正在做的. 
1. Goldman may be the closest thing we have to an Illuminati. 
2. I must report to our overlords in the Illuminati that we've been exposed. 
3. The Illuminati are at it again! I call down a Pox on them!
