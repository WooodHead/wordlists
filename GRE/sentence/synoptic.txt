1. There are many vortex patterns on synoptic maps. 摘要天气图上有许多种涡旋型式。 
2. These results are compared with the synoptic facts. 最后把理论结果与观测事实作了比较. 
3. A methodology of objective air analysis based on synoptic climatological approaches is proposed in this paper. 本文提出了一种基于天气气候学途径的气团客观分类实施方案. 
1. The Bergeron and Spatial Synoptic Classification systems focus on the origin of air masses that define the climate of a region. 
2. I start going through all the sites, the synoptic charts, the wave buoys, the models.
