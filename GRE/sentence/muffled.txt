1. There were low, muffled voices rising from the hallway. 从走廊里隐约传来了低沉的说话声。 
2. She heard him let out a pitiful, muffled groan. 她听到他发出一声令人悲悯的低沉的呻吟声。 
3. The bear exposed its teeth in a muffled growl. 那只熊龇出牙齿，发出一声低沉的吼叫。 
1. Muffled, distorted voices cry desperately throughout the song. 
2. We love you, but her words were muffled. 
3. Moral impotence is a muffled, crippled agony.
