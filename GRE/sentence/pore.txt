1. Waves of misery penetrated every pore. 痛苦深彻骨髓。 
2. She oozes sexuality from every pore. 她浑身上下每个毛孔都散发着性感。 
3. I see him chafe and fret at every pore. 我看见他非常暴躁. 
1. Sweat broke out through every pore of his body. 
2. All creatures else pore downward to the ground. 
3. Sweat sprung from every pink pore in his innocent face.
