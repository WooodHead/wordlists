1. We reached a beautiful grotto , whose entrance was almost hiden by the vine. 我们到达了一个美丽的洞穴, 洞的进口几乎被藤蔓遮掩著. 
2. Water trickles through an underground grotto. 水沿着地下岩洞流淌。 
3. The people of hope to visiting grotto come from Africa. 希望参观岩洞的人们非洲. 
1. The Glowworm Grotto looks just like the night sky. 
2. The Glowworm Grotto is nothing like the night sky. 
3. The grotto smells like salt and blood and bat shit.
