1. All around was bubbling a cacophony of voices. 周围人声嘈杂。 
2. From its cacophony of sound, the room has suddenly become very still. 本来众声嘈杂的屋子里,突然变得非常肃静. 
3. Instant cacophony as the crowd inched forward step by step, coming, they're coming! 紧跟着人声嘈乱起来,整群的人象机器似的一齐向前拥了一寸,又一寸, 来了! 来了! 
1. But in truth theirs is the most beautiful cacophony. 
2. Raw noise, sonic shocks, chaos and cacophony abound. 
3. That effort imploded in a cacophony of charges and countercharges.
