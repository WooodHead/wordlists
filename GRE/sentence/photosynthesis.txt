1. Our current research topic is photosynthesis. 我们现在研究的课题是光合作用。 
2. Rates of leaf photosynthesis have little relationship to yield. 叶片的光合作用速率与产量的关系不大. 
3. In apple trees photosynthesis occurs almost exclusively in the leaves. 苹果树的光合作用几乎只发生在叶内. 
1. The pigments are the chlorophyll which carry out photosynthesis. 
2. Plants make their own food through photosynthesis using sunlight.
