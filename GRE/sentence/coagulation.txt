1. Blood becomes stickier to help coagulation in case of a cut. 割伤的时候，血液会变得更为黏稠以助于凝结。 
2. Encounters of like charges act to diminish the coagulation rate. 同性带电粒子间的碰撞作用减少凝聚率. 
3. The more intense the source the more rapid the coagulation ensues. 源越强,随后发生的凝聚越迅速. 
1. Or a conception, or coagulation of mixed seed? 
2. Basslines support a mangled coagulation of screams, yelps and rants about lurking terror, political machination and urban dread. 
3. It is clear that we're only scratching the surface of coagulation complexity in organisms with circulations.
