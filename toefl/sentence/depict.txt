Apart from statues representing deities, kings, and named members of the elite that can be called formal, there is another group of three-dimensional representations that depicts generic figures, frequently servants, from the non-elite population. 除去为神灵、国王以及有记载的贵族成员所塑的雕像会有特定的外形，其他的非贵族成员和频繁出现的仆人都是用普通外表来描绘的。
