In fact, when tapes of begging tree swallows were played at an artificial swallow nest containing an egg, the egg in that “noisy” nest was taken or destroyed by predators before the egg in a nearby quiet nest in 29 of 37 trials.　事实上，如果在一个盛有鸟蛋的人工燕窝旁播放树燕讨食的录音，这个试验做了37次，有29次的结果都是，这个“嘈杂”鸟巢里的树燕蛋比周围安静的鸟巢里的树燕蛋更早被捕食者掠走或破坏。
