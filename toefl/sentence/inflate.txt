During courtship and aggressive displays, the turkey enlarges its colored neck collar by inflating sacs in the neck region and then flings about a pendulous part of the colored signaling apparatus as it utters calls designed to attract or repel. 在求爱期和发起进攻时，火鸡通过给颈部液囊充气扩张颈圈，晃动着下垂的鲜艳的信号装置，随之发出叫声来吸引异性或击退敌人。
