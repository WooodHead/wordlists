The explanation may be that the terrestrial planets were once much larger and richer in these materials but eventually lost them because of these bodies' relative closeness to the Sun, which meant that their temperatures were relatively high. 有一种解释认为，类地行星曾经体积更大并且物质构成上更为丰富多样，但因为它们距太阳较近致使温度相对较高而最终失去这些物质。
