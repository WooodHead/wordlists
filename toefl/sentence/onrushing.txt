The onrushing water arising from these flash floods likely also formed the odd teardrop-shaped "islands" (resembling the miniature versions seen in the wet sand of our beaches at low tide) that have been found on the plains close to the ends of the outflow channels. 由泛滥的洪水而产生的激流可能也形成奇怪的泪滴状小岛（就像是在低潮时湿沙地或海滩上看到的缩小版本一样），已经在靠近出流通道末尾处的平原上被看到。
