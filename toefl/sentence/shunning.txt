For instance, some social groups employ shunning (a person can remain in the community, but others are forbidden to interact with the person) as a device to bring into line individuals whose behavior goes beyond that allowed by the particular group.  例如，一些社会群体采取规避措施（人可以留在群体中，但禁止其他成员与其交流），从而将特定群体中逾矩的个体慢慢同化与他人一致。
