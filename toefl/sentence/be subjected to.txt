Indeed, stability of the biological clock's period is one of its major features, even when the organism's environment is subjected to considerable changes in factors, such as temperature, that would be expected to affect biological activity strongly. 的确，稳定性是生物钟最重要的特性之一，即使生物所处环境的诸多要素发生显著变化，例如温度可能会对生物活性产生很大影响。
