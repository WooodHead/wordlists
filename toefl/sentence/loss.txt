Loss of water through the leaves is reduced by means of dense hairs covering waxy leaf surfaces, by the closure of pores during the hottest times to reduce water loss, and by the rolling up or shedding of leaves at the beginning of the dry season. 覆盖在蜡质叶子层表面的浓密的绒毛,在温度最高的时候闭合气孔, 在干旱季初期卷起或脱落叶片都可以减少经过叶片的水分的流失。
