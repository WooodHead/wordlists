1. A footstep in the snow. Madame Defarge. 雪地里有脚步声, 是德伐日太太. 
2. Ruth listened and started nervously at every passing footstep. 露丝谛听着,每次有脚步声过去她就心惊肉跳. 
3. I listened for a footstep. 我留心听着脚步声. 
1. Jotting down each dull footstep with a melancholy dub of his staff. 
2. Each sometimes stops and slowly imprints a deeper footstep in the fallen leaves. 
3. And, along the way, he has a media that tracks his every footstep. 
1. The servant walked two or three footsteps behind his master. 仆人走在主人后面,相隔两三步。 
2. He heard soft footsteps coming up the stair. 他听见有人上楼的轻微脚步声。 
3. Her footsteps were clearly marked in the snow. 她的足迹清晰地印在雪地上。
