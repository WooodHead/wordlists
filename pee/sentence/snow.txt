1. The first snow came a month earlier than usual. 第一场雪比往年提早了一个月。 
2. I'd been a fool letting him snow me with his big ideas. 我真蠢，居然被他的胡乱吹嘘给蒙蔽了。 
3. The snow was light and noiseless as it floated down. 雪花轻盈飘落，无声无息。 
1. It can be very effective in melting snow quickly. 
2. Snow may lie until June on the highest mountains. 
3. I wonder about the stability of the snow line. 
1. It will not take long for the melted snow to soak into the soil. 不用多久融雪就会渗入土壤。 
2. The river has swollen with melted snow. 雪融河涨。 
3. I was so excited to see snow that I was indifferent to the cold. 我看到雪激动得连寒冷都不在乎了。
