1. The blustery winds of spring had dropped to a gentle breeze. 呼啸的春风已经减弱，成了习习的微风。 
2. The tops of the trees rippled in the breeze. 树冠在微风中婆娑摇曳。 
3. The sun went in, and the breeze became cold. 云层遮住了太阳，微风有了些凉意。 
1. A land-breeze...Milk-warm wi' breath of spice an' bloom. 
2. There is generally a light breeze to modify the heat. 
3. The sea breeze was...ruffling the...surface of the anchorage. 
1. It was steaming hot; there was no breeze at all. 天气闷热,一点风也没有。 
2. The banner fluttered in the breeze. 旗帜在微风中飘扬。
