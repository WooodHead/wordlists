2. Moisture in the atmosphere condensed into dew during the night. 大气中的水汽在夜间凝结成了露珠. 
3. The green boughs glittered with all their pearls of dew. 绿枝上闪烁着露珠的光彩. 
1. The beasts were glutting themselves on dew and grass. 
2. The paddocks glittered with dew under the cool early sun.

1. Dew had fallen heavily since the wind had dropped. 风已停息,露水更浓了。 
2. Pearls of dew glistened on the grass. 草地上露珠晶莹剔透。
