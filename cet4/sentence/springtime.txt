1. A profusion of leaves bursts out on trees in the springtime. 春天许许多多的叶子从树上冒出来. 
2. The blossom on the trees looks lovely in springtime. 春天树上的花很漂亮. 
3. It was springtime and the slopes were ablaze with almond blossoms. 时当春季,怒放的扁桃花使那片山坡鲜红似火. 
1. Springtime to me means a welcome return to LIGHT! 
2. Wading pleasantly through springtime Arkansas meadows brave with daisies. 
3. It might as well be a springtime stroll.
