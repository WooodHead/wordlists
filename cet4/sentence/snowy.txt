1. The snowy street, like the church, assumed a dumb, lifeless aspect. 积雪覆盖的街道就像教堂一样，显得沉闷、毫无生气。 
2. We strode across the snowy fields. 我们大步流星地穿过雪封的旷野。 
3. It was a dead - cold snowy afternoon with no signs of life outside. 那是一个寒冷的下午,天还下着雪,外面一个人也没有. 
1. Chill wind It's mid-January, cold and snowy. 
2. That's it for our snowy live blog today. 
3. The tossing waves,...the snowy, curling caps.
