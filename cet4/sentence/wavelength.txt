1. It's great to work with people who are on the same wavelength. 与志同道合的人一起工作真是太棒了。 
2. Blue light has a shorter wavelength than red. 蓝光的波长比红光的短。 
3. Radio One has broadcast on this wavelength for years. 广播1台已经用这个波长广播多年了. 
1. We don't mean small in terms of wavelength. 
2. Hence entanglement and the de Broglie wavelength is explained. 
3. Carroll has struggled to get on the same wavelength.
